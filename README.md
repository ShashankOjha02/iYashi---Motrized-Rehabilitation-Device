### Product Summary

-   Iyashi is a motorized rehabilitation device that aids individuals to regain their motor functions. Iyashi works hand in hand to create personalized rehabilitation training for specific accidents, primarily caused by strokes and other nerve injuries. 

-   The demo device showcases a glove that makes resistive training for easy hand-based rehabilitation. This device connects to our UI-friendly app that allows patients to directly monitor their progress via visually-friendly graphs from data taken from the device. A hand was chosen as the demo because it requires the most movement, however, this same concept can be applied to legs, arms, or any motor function. 

-   The device may provide exercises to target specific movements by altering tensions on varying fingers. In addition, it offers to strengthen the goal of having the patient resist the highest tension offered by the device. Lastly, it provides edema control by directly targeting their active motion.

### Mission Statement: rehabilitating the healthcare system.

-   Our mission is rooted in our name, Iyashi stems from the Japanese word for healing. We believe everyone regardless of their race, ethnicity and financial barriers deserves to regain their mobility, as it is an extension of their humanity. 

-   At Iyashi, we believe everyone has the right to good health, so we want to develop a device that helps restore motor functions for individuals who suffer from accidents. As many people are limited by financial constraints to visit an orthopedic specialist or continuous appointments with physiotherapists, we developed a low-cost device to provide therapy straight from one home.

### Define the problem

-   Imagine you suddenly get into a car crash. In the United States, an average of $60 000 is spent on hospital bills and now you need to pay for rehabilitation treatment in order to return to your everyday life. The average cost of outpatient stroke rehabilitation services and medications within the first year is $17,081 USD [1]. Also, taken in the mean day off time is 125 +/- 69 days [2] for these injuries and currently, 64% of Americans are now living paycheck to paycheck [3].

-   As Canadians with a public healthcare system in Canada, we are fortunate enough to have most of these costs covered. But imagine that you do not have health insurance, likely living in a dangerous area and working a blue-collar job more prone to injuries. Unfortunately, this nightmare is actually the reality for the majority of people around the world.

-   Even in developed countries like the United States, almost 20% of the population is not covered by health insurance, accounting for almost 65 million residents! Now with an average income of $31,133 USD, major hospital bills, on top of rehabilitation treatment is next to impossible [6]! This situation is even worse for refugees, individuals in remote communities, and in developing countries.

-   For this reason, iYashi is passionate to create a more affordable and sustainable Rehabilitation system that can bring more equity to those who need it. 

### Current Options

-   Treatment of arm paresis is ranked among the top ten research priorities relating to life by stroke survivors, caregivers and health professionals [4].

-   Most arm and hand rehabilitation treatments are due to strokes, which is the leading cause of long-term disability amongst adults.

-   Also, despite appropriate care and neurorehabilitation, over 60% of stroke survivors suffer from incomplete recovery of motor functions compromising their daily living.

### Product and Applications 

-   Product Description:

-   We wanna create kits developed by working with medical professionals that cost a fraction of the cost.

-   Iyashi uses high torque servo motors that control tensioning in strings to create resistance and support-based training to help regain motor functions. Studies have found that calculated progressive resistive motor training can create tremendous success in regaining motor functions.

-   Our product is currently focused around rehabiltiing hand and finger movements, since they are one of the highest ranked motor body parts needed for working and the most prone to injury.

-   Causes for hand therapy for tendonitis, tendon injuries, fractures of the hand, wrist and elbow, carpal tunnel syndrome, trigger finger, tennis elbow, cumulative trauma, and all upper extremity trauma and injury. [5]

-   Treatment:

-   May begin as soon as 24-48 hours after a stroke.

-   Early, personalized therapy improves the chance of recovery.

-   Treatment will improve their range of motion, aid in rebuilding their strength and practice fine motor skills

-   It must be stressed that the device is not sufficient on a case-by-case basis, as some patients may require injections to help spasticity, electrical stimulation therapy, or oral medications.

-   Goal 1: Affordability + Personalization

-   When ordering from the website the user will input the dimensions of their targeted body parts and the motor function they are having trouble with, in order to receive a customized garment built just for them made from ethically-sourced and sustainable materials. If additional help is needed, consultations will be conducted with a medical specialist. 

-   Next, the user will pay a low-cost monthly subscription fee to rent the device. The user will follow a personalized daily exercise plan and the device, connected to a smartphone will track their progress. The device will communicate with the smartphone and store data using protocol buffers, in order to serialize data for quick and secure communication. 

-   Goal 2: Smart Contract and Financing

-   If the fee is too expensive, we plan on offering various financing options to ensure that our product is accessible to all. Our database will look at their personal information such as income, marital status, and a number of dependents and help them find funding to cover the cost of their treatment, through government funding, donors, NGOs, etc.

-   We do understand that there may be language barriers  Using Ethereum blockchain's solidity-based smart contract ... loans and subscriptions can be translated and placed in easier terms and translated to any language so anyone can understand them. The blockchain network will also create an easier system to tally up donations from multiple donors. 

-   Goal 3: 

-   Work with doctors, governments, and hospitals to give the UN right of health to everyone

-   As we are not professionals, we wish to bring this product to everyone that needs it. So we strive to work with the right professionals to do so in the future.

-   Protocol Buffers 

-   Protocol buffers were implemented to allow fast and seamless data transfer between the rehabilitation glove and the front-end. A message declaration was made for individual users, containing field types for their name, user id, the resistance they are training at, and a timestamp of when they train. Each user is categorized into another message declaration, as a database for all Iyashi users. When the users use their rehabilitation glove, their user info and training resistances are automatically logged into the database. The data is serialized into a string, which will then be passed as an HTTPS request to the front-end, seamlessly updating the user progress as they use the device. By serializing the data, the information can be transferred in real-time, allowing user progress to be visualized as they use the device.

Script:

Imagine you suddenly get into a car crash. In the United States, an average of $60 000 is spent on hospital bills and now you need to pay for rehabilitation treatment in order to return to your everyday life. The average cost of outpatient stroke rehabilitation services and medications within the first year is $17, 000. Being permanent residents in Canada, we are fortunate enough to have most of these costs covered. Now imagine not having insurance and using your entire year's worth of income for your hospital bills. This nightmare is a reality for many people around the world, including 64% of Americans that are currently living paycheck to paycheck. This situation is even worse for refugees, individuals in remote communities, and developing countries.

For this reason, we at Iyashi are passionate to create a more affordable Rehabilitation system that can bring more equity to those who need it. We believe everyone regardless of their race, ethnicity, and financial barriers deserves to regain their mobility, as it is an extension of their humanity.  For this reason, it has been our mission to develop a device that helps restore motor functions for individuals involved in accidents.

Studies have found that calculated progressive resistive motor training can create tremendous success in regaining motor functions.

 Iyashi is built to provide affordable rehabilitation treatment through three main pillars: Affordability, Ease of Finance, and Professional Help. Let's walk us through the Iyashi process

§  (SIGN UP SCREEN)

 While signing up, iYashi will get medical and personal information to help you to help finance your specific rehabilitation needs. The medical device needed will be rented from iYashi, so that materials can be recycled after, and the usage cost is less/

Personal Information such as age, marital status, disability, and average income will help IYashi find governmental aid from grants, benefits, and donors that you qualify for to accommodate your financial needs. The discounted price will then be conveyed using Etheyrum Solidity-based smart contracts, to provide a leasing option understandable to any language and give the security guaranteed by a contract. The contact will also secure the privacy of the user.

(SMART CONTRACT SOMEWHERE HERE^)

  When ordering from the website the user will input the specific dimension of their body parts and the motor function they are having trouble with. If help is needed consultation can be done with a doctor.

-        (DEMO -- Show home screen)

Next, the user will pay a low-cost monthly subscription fee to rent the device. The parts 3d-printed for them will be made of recyclable material.   The user will follow a personalized daily exercise plan and the device, connected to a smartphone will track their progress. The device will communicate with the smartphone and store data using protocol buffers, in order

to serialize data for quick and secure communication.

 After receiving their package, the user can run through various daily exercises with custom resistances to help bring their motor functions back to normal---all in the comfort of their home. The glove, for instance, helps patients suffering from Ataxia, a disorder that affects the 

hand---the limb with the most motion variation in the body. 

The motors also uses PID controllers to create smooth and fluids motions that never overshoots in tenion and never hurts the user.  (show PID code pop up beside the demo) 

The resistance data recorded after the exercise will then be communicated to the cloud and their smartphone using protocol buffers in order to efficiently serialize data for quick and secure communication. (show Protocall buffer code pop up beside demo) 

Here is a summary of the technical specifications and tools we used to create the glove demo

 Iyashi is a project that is very close to our heart for us, so we drafted a timeline to continue to work on it after the hackathon.

Some short-term goals include:

Consulting with medical professionals to improve the prototype as well as create more bionics for every motorized body part, so we can reach out to as many individuals as possible.

 In the long term by only having a total production cost of only 45 dollars, the Iyashi has the potential to tap into various other major markets including affordable remote fitness and human kinematic research.

  With your support, we can help million.

 Iyashi, innovating home healthcare.
